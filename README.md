# REACT 2024 - COURSE

This is my first app which I have built from the React Complete Guide (incl. React Router and Redux) course with Max (Acadamind.) I have used it as a refresher on the React skills which I have learnt during my time at BrainStation.

## Day 6

I realized I was trying to destructure an array and pass the values to the SubMenuButton Component causing the app to crash everytime the state was changed in the menu content section. It was a silly mistake. Also, changed the the strings in buttonContent array located in the data.js file back to its original state. I used .toLowerCase string obj property to get the case to match the obj located within dynamicContentMenu array in data.js.

## Day 5 - Refactoring and Components

I have refactored some of the code in order to continue expand my knowledge and refactored code so that it was a bit more of a challenge for myself. While the pacing has been good, I have incorporated the basic SCSS syntax to help the styling look a little bit cleaner. I also learned that the styling sheet is NOT scoped to a specific component. It is scoped globally which means that if you were to use the tag or className elsewhere in the file, it will still be styled based off of that stylesheet.

Also I have added a README.md file to track my progress and will be using it as a method of journalling until I get my note taking application to continue to jot down what my progress and journey through the course as time progresses.

Another thing I have started looking into was how to use the markup language correctly. The source I used for this basic file is [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](Basic Syntax | Markdown Guide)
